      PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY<br>

The goal of the project is to measure what makes particular aspects of language easier or harder to learn and understand.<br><br>

PROCEDURES<br>

You will be asked to read or listen to language, and answer questions about what you’ve read or heard. The sentences may be in English or in a made-up language that you will learn during the experiment. The experiment involves a single session that will take up to an hour; there will be up to five sessions, but most participants will only participate in a single session.<br><br>

RISKS/DISCOMFORTS<br>

The risks associated with participation in this study are no greater than those encountered in daily life.<br><br>
BENEFITS<br>

There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study. This study may benefit society if the results lead to a better understanding of what makes certain aspects of language easier or harder to learn and understand.<br><br>

VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND RIGHT TO WITHDRAW<br>

Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary: You choose whether to participate. If you decide not to participate, there are no penalties, and you will not lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled.<br>

If you choose to participate in the study, you can stop your participation at any time, without any penalty or loss of benefits.<br><br>

CONFIDENTIALITY<br>
Any study records that identify you will be kept confidential to the extent possible by law. The records from your participation may be reviewed by people responsible for making sure that research is done properly. Otherwise, records that identify you will be available only to people working on the study, unless you give permission for other people to see the records.<br>

Any study records that include your name will be kept in a password-protected database. On all records of test results we will use a code number rather than your name.<br><br>

COMPENSATION<br>

You will receive compensation in proportion to the length of the session.<br><br>

IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS<br>

You can ask questions about this research study now or at any time during the study, by talking to the researcher(s) working with you or by emailing Dr. Tal Linzen at linzen@nyu.edu.<br>

If you have questions about your rights as a research participant or feel that you have not been treated fairly, please contact the NYU Institutional Review Board at ask.humansubjects@nyu.edu or 212.998.4808.
